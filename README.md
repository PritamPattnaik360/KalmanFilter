# KalmanFilter
This Python script demonstrates the implementation of a Kalman Filter to estimate the position and velocity of an object undergoing linear motion. The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm used for state estimation, combining information from a series of measurements over time with predictions generated by a dynamic model.

The plot shows the true position, noisy measurements, and estimated position over time.

## The Math Behind It

### Prediction Step:
- Predicted State:
The next state estimate (x̂ₖ) is predicted based on the current state (x̂ₖ₋₁) and the dynamics of the system represented by the state transition matrix (A).
Mathematically:
x̂ₖ = A * x̂ₖ₋₁
- Predicted Covariance:
The covariance matrix (Pₖ) predicts the uncertainty associated with the state estimate for the next time step. It's updated based on the process noise (Q) that accounts for system dynamics.
Mathematically:
Pₖ = A * Pₖ₋₁ * Aᵀ + Q

### Update Step:
- Kalman Gain:
The Kalman Gain (Kₖ) determines how much we trust the measurement versus the prediction. It's calculated based on the predicted covariance (Pₖ), the measurement matrix (H), and the measurement noise (R).
Mathematically:
Kₖ = Pₖ * Hᵀ * (H * Pₖ * Hᵀ + R)⁻¹
- Updated State Estimate:
Using the Kalman Gain, we update the state estimate (x̂ₖ) based on the difference between the actual measurement (zₖ) and the predicted measurement.
Mathematically:
x̂ₖ = x̂ₖ + Kₖ * (zₖ - H * x̂ₖ)
- Updated Covariance:
Finally, after incorporating the measurement, we update the covariance matrix (Pₖ) to reflect the reduced uncertainty.
Mathematically:
Pₖ = (I - Kₖ * H) * Pₖ
